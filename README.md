# Edge-Based Crop Monitoring System using AI

This repository presents a prototype system that explores
the use of edge-level artificial intelligence for crop
health monitoring and agricultural decision support.

The focus of this work is on system architecture and
integration of AI inference with embedded sensing.

## Project Aim
To evaluate how lightweight AI models can be used at
the edge in combination with environmental sensor data
to support agricultural monitoring applications.

## System Architecture
The system consists of three layers:
- Image inference module
- Embedded sensor acquisition
- Decision and advisory logic

Edge processing is prioritized to reduce latency and
dependence on cloud connectivity.

## Technologies Used
- Python for image inference
- Embedded C/C++ for ESP32 firmware
- TensorFlow Lite (conceptual usage)
- Environmental sensors

## Project Status
✔ System architecture implemented  
✔ Inference pipeline tested  
🔄 Model refinement ongoing
